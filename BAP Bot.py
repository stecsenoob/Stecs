r"Sarah was sitting on the chair, in only a red thong. She had her legs spread wide over the chair, and her brown hair flowed over her bare boobs. I was getting excited, Sarah was so hot. She ripped off the thong as she stood up, walked right past me and shut the door I had just passed through. She turned to face me, her feet strongly planted, and forced her hand down my pants. I unblocked my belt, and she tore my pants down to my ankles. She fell to her knees and removed my boxers. I could feel it, my dick was already starting to swell up. God, Sarah was hot. She started on the tip of my dick. She swirled her tongue around it a little. She almost immediately started to massage my balls vigorously. She then took on my whole dick, deep throating it. I could feel it, I was gonna cum. My balls were urging for it to come out. I moaned, it felt so good. I grunted a little as it started, and I cummed inside of her mouth. She pulled away, and swallowed, then smiled. My shirt was torn off and she was rubbing my dick with her hands. Then, she was on her hands and knees. I rubbed my dick, and slipped on the condom from the bowl. My dick was throbbing and I was excited. I slowly slid into her pussy and she squeaked quietly. I began to thrust myself. Faster and faster, I wasn't controlling myself, and she bounced and bounced, moaning and moaning until she screamed. We changed positions a few times, then my cum splurged out at work just thinking about it. Then my assistant asked for some.")
